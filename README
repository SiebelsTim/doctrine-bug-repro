# Reproduction for bug where ManyToOne relation is reset when refetching entity with fetch=EAGER

## Prerequisites

1. composer install
2. ./vendor/bin/doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
3. php create_user.php beberlei
4. php create_product.php DBAL
5. php create_bug.php 1 1 1

Note that this happens only when Bug::reporter has fetch mode set to EAGER.
And this only happens when trying to set the relation to null.
